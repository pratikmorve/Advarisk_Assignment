# Flask News Search App

This is a simple Flask application that allows users to search for news articles using keywords. It also keeps track of the search history and caches search results to improve performance.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed
- Install the required packages by running the following command from the project directory: `pip install -r requirements.txt
`
- News API key from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

## Project Completion Time

I completed this project in approximately 3 hours.
